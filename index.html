                    Hi!  My name is Caitlin Trask.  I am 26-years-old living in the lovely City Park neighborhood of Denver, CO!  I recently got a great new job at VF Corporation as an eCommerce Merchandiser for the JanSport brand.  I am about 6 weeks into my job and am loving it so far.  I’m excited to learn coding as it’s going to give me such a leg-up in my career and possibly an entire new career path!  I am particularly interested in web design and application development.  I’d love you to take a look at my portfolio and see what I’ve created so far!
