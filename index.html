                    Hi!  My name is Caitlin Trask.  I am 26-years-old living in the lovely City Park neighborhood of Denver, CO!  I recently got a great new job at VF Corporation as an eCommerce Merchandiser for the JanSport brand.  I am about 6 weeks into my job and am loving it so far.  
                    <br><br>
                    In my free time, I love to be outdoors, try new breweries with friends, shop (a little too much), and binge my favorite online series.  Currently can’t get enough of <i>Yellowstone</i> and <i>The Great British Baking Show</i>!
                    <br><br>
                    I’m excited to learn coding as it’s going to give me such a leg-up in my career and possibly an entire new career path!  I am particularly interested in web design and application development.  I’d love you to take a look at my portfolio and see what I’ve created so far!
